# SoundImager

## The idea
Basically a small program that generates an RGB / Greyscaled image based on the values read from a soundfile.

### Milestones
✔️ Read a WAV soundfile and convert is as a BMP imagefile

There is no particular purpose on the existence of this small project, and it is actually quite limited, but I just had this funny idea. 

I don't actually recommend using this program as you inevitably lose some sound precision due to the 8 bits scaling (0-255) of it.
