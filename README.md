# SoundImager

## The idea
Basically a small program that generates an RGB / Greyscaled image based on the values read from a soundfile.

## Milestones
‚úîÔ∏è Read a WAV soundfile and convert is as a BMP image file.

‚úîÔ∏è Read a BMP imagefile and output it as a WAV sound file.

## Let's try it out
This is the sound file input : a plain 16 bits wave file: [Listen to it there üîä](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jTyiqbAVTWPcqqpqBmTR3PzEHyl-GvBJ/view?usp=sharing)

We read the wave soundfile and convert is as a BMP image file
![WAV2BMP](http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1dZ4gwOlsTbUAaNQz4zRrv9uxQ0ea3nH0)

We obtain this greyscale BMP image as a result, that represents our sound !

We then read the freshly created BMP image and output it as a WAVE soundfile
![BMP2WAV](http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1c-KsVQOXqZVo7G1a-Hx8Tg22jpsGECKY)

This is the sound file output :  [Listen to it there üîä](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sh2ZESsFRGgfnig0Yuu0mJX-G6UknPT9/view?usp=sharing)

## But why ?
There is no particular purpose on the existence of this small project, and it is actually quite limited, but I just had this funny idea. 

I don't actually recommend using this program as you inevitably lose some sound precision due to the 8 bits scaling (0-255) of it.

Have fun!
